Simple select : selection and projection 
========================================
use hr;
select * from employees;
select employee_id,last_name,salary,department_id from employees;
desc departments;
select department_id,location_id from departments;
select last_name,salary,(salary*12)+100 from employees;
select last_name,salary,(salary*12)+100 annualsal from employees;
select last_name,job_id,commission_pct from employees;
select last_name ,12*salary*commission_pct from employees;

select concat(last_name,job_id) from employees;
select concat(last_name," works as ",job_id) empwithjobid from employees;



select employee_id,department_id from employees; 
select department_id from employees;
select distinct department_id from employees;

desc departments 

Restriction and sorting :
==========================

Restriction : we use where clause:
select employee_id,last_name,department_id from employees where department_id=50;
select employee_id,last_name,hire_date,department_id from employees where last_name='Vollman';
select employee_id,last_name,hire_date,salary from employees where hire_date='1997-10-10';

1. how to get employees who joined in year 1996?

select employee_id,last_name,hire_date,salary from employees where hire_date='1997-03-19';
select employee_id,last_name,hire_date,salary from employees where DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, '%Y')=1996;

select employee_id,last_name,hire_date,salary from employees where DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, '%y')=96;

select employee_id,last_name,Date_FORMAT(hire_date,'%W %D %M %Y'),salary from employees where DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, '%Y')=1996;

Restriction with comparision operators:

= > >= < <= <>  
between  ---- and ----  (lower and upper limit are inclusive )
IN(set)
who are employees working under manger_id : 100,101,201
LIKE(pattern)
IS NULL 



select  last_name,salary from employees where salary <=8000;
select  last_name,salary from employees where salary =5800;
select  last_name,salary from employees where salary >=8000;
select  last_name,salary from employees where salary <> 8000;

select  last_name,salary from employees where salary between 2500 and 3500;
select employee_id, last_name,salary,manager_id  from employees;
select employee_id, last_name,salary,manager_id  from employees where manager_id in (100,101,201);
select first_name from employees where first_name like 'S%';
select last_name from employees where last_name like '_o%';
select last_name from employees where last_name like '__u%';
select last_name from employees where last_name like '%o%';
select last_name from employees where last_name like '%op%';
select last_name ,manager_id from employees  where manager_id IS NULL;

Logical operators  AND OR NOT 
=============================

1 find the employees whose salary is >=5000 and  job_id which matches 'MAN' pattern 

select employee_id,last_name,job_id,salary from employees 
         where ((salary>=5000) and (job_id LIKE '%MAN%'));
         
select last_name,job_id from employees where job_id NOT IN ('IT_PROG','ST_MAN');         

select last_name,job_id,salary from employees where ((job_id = 'SA_REP')  OR (job_id = 'AD_PRES')) and (salary>5000);

select last_name,job_id,salary from employees where (job_id = 'SA_REP')  OR (job_id = 'AD_PRES') and (salary>5000);

Sorting in  Asccending and Decending order :
-------------------------------------------
select last_name,job_id,department_id,hire_date  from employees 
     order by hire_date DESC;  

select last_name,department_id, salary*12 annualsal  from employees 
    order by annualsal;     
     
select last_name,department_id, salary*12 annualsal  from employees 
    order by annualsal , last_name desc;
